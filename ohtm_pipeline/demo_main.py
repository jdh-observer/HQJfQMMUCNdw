OHTM-Pipeline:

With this board you can select every option for your topic model.
You can set the different options on and off via "True" and "False".

First set the required paths.
    - the first "mallet_path" to your mallet directory.
     (see https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/topic-modeling-and-mallet)
    - the second one to your working folder. This folder is your working environment.
      All models are saved there and can be loaded from this folder.a
    - your stopword file must be stored in this working folder.
"""

"""
This demo is used to test, if the code runs proper and is linked to the demo folder and its demo files.
- You can test importing the text files and preprocessing them. 
- You can print the prepared ohmt_files or create the graphs for this file or use the search functions
- Topic modeling is not able, because you need to install mallet first.
